Given an integer array A of size n. Find and print all the leaders present in the input array. An array element A[i] is called Leader, 
if all the elements following it (i.e. present at its right) are less than or equal to A[i].
Print all the leader elements separated by space and in the same order they are present in the input array.

Input Format :-
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
Each test case consist a an integer N , which describes the length of array.
N integer number representing elements of the array.

Constraints :-
1 <= T <= 200
1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= arr[i]<= 10^4

Output Format :-
leaders of array (separated by space)
